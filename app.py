    "longwall mining": "Longwall mining is an underground coal mining method where a long wall of coal is mined in a single slice, typically 0.6‚Äì1.0 m thick.",
    "how it works": "It uses a mechanized shearer that moves back and forth across a coal face. Hydraulic roof supports hold up the roof temporarily while coal is removed, and the roof is allowed to collapse behind the operation (called 'goaf').",
    "equipment": "Key equipment includes the shearer, armored face conveyor (AFC), hydraulic roof supports, stage loader, and belt conveyor system.",
    "advantages": "High production rates, efficient coal recovery (up to 80%), and relatively low labor requirement compared to other underground mining methods.",
    "disadvantages": "High upfront capital cost, less flexible for varying seam thickness, and can cause significant subsidence above ground.",
    "safety": "Regular equipment inspections, dust suppression systems, methane monitoring, ventilation, and proper roof control plans.",
    "goaf": "The goaf is the collapsed area behind the roof supports after coal extraction in longwall mining."
